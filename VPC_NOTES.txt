- what is network?
------------------
connection of two or more differents nodes and if they able to communicate  together 
its called network

- port number and tcp and udp
-----------------------------
a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.

- what is UDP and TCP
---------------------
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. 
A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. 
Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, -
retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

- what is vpc
--------------
vpc is a webservice provided by aws and it is logically separated or isolated 
from other vpc. (by default between two vpc will not have any communication)

- what is subnet?
-----------------
dividing or bifurcation of network in to smaller parts

- what is route table?
----------------------
route table is predominant component of vpc, it contain defined rules for establish 
communication between two entity (among vpc's, among subnets and internet gateway)

- NACL & security groups(NIC) 
-----------------------------
NACL(network access control list) is used in subnet level
it is stateless
priority basis rule arrangement
we can allow and deny rule
we can create 200 NACL 
we can create 20 NACL rule and can enahance upto 40
minimum rule number should be 1 maximum 32766

SG(security group) is used in instance level and attach with ENI
is is statefull
not a priority basis arrangement
we can only allow rules
we can create 2500 SG and enhance up to 5000
we can create 120 rules, 60 OB and 60 IB

- elastic ip
------------
it is static public ip, used to mask or hide instance failuer from users.
even if system shut down and when it return back, we will be able to see the same ip
address if elastic ip is associated earlier, the primamry purpose is ip should 
preserve even regardless of any state

- what is NAT gateway
---------------------
it is vpc component used to bring internet to private subnet(only outbound connection)

jumphost or bastion host
----------------------
create subnet in private subnet with private ip, use another server(proxy) to access
private server consequently we can prevent direct access to server.

- file transfer by using scp
----------------------------
file transfer between two servers
syntax:-
--------
scp -i <Destination_Server_keyname> <intented_file_name> <user_name>@<ip_address>:<destination_path>

- egress only internet gateway
-------------------------------
same as nat gateway used for ipv6 networks

- vpc peering
-------------
establish a connection between two vpc's privately is called vpc peering
equation for find vpc peering:-
------------------------------
n(n-1)/2 or (n-1)n/2

- vpc transitive gateway
------------------------
sam as vpc peering, to overcome vpc peering flaws we can use vpc transit gateway.

- vpc quotas
-------------
vpc 5 vpc in a region
nat gateway 5 in a AZ
igw 5 in a region
subnet 200 in a VPC
nacl 200 in region
peering active 50
peeirng pending 25
elastic ip 5

- endpoints
-----------
endpoints are vpc component used to commuicate between two defferent services privately 
we have two types of endpoint:
- gateway endpoint
two services only we can use for gateway endpoint such as s3 and dynamoDB
here we using gateway an private ip to communicate bewtween two services
- interface endpoint
here we using ENI and private dns to communicate bewteen two services.

- VPN
-----
virtual private network used to establish secured private connection over network for
communication and resource sharing

tpye os technologies:-
GRE (generic routign encapsulation)
DMVPN (dynamic multipoint VPN)
IP SEC

- AWS VPN
  - SITE-TO-SITE (between two compnay baranch)
  - REMOTE ACCESS VPN (between company and employee)
  - DIRECT CONNECT (between two company branch through pysical medium)

- Reachability Analyzer
-----------------------
used to troublshoot between two components or entity in vpc

- VPC FLOW LOGS
---------------
used to generate vpc traffic logs
